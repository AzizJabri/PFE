**This is our end of studies (PFE) internship project**

We developed an e-commerce application using Spring Boot for the backend, React for the frontend, Postgres for the main database and Redis for the caching layer.

After Developing the application, we setup build, test and deploy pipelines for the frontend and the backend to deploy our containerized application using docker on Azure Kubernetes Service.

Finally we setup monitoring and alerting for our kubernetes cluster using prometheus and grafana installed as pods inside the cluster.
